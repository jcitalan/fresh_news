## Branch naming conventions

The project uses semantic branch names in the style of
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) for consistency and to help with
the release process.

To keep branch names informative and consistent, these are the conventions for valid branch names:

* `main`
* `feat/*` - New features
* `fix/*` - Bug fixes

Pushing to a different branch will fail CI, but if more branch types are required we can easily expand the list.
